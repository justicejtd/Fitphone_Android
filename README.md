# SMTeamAndroid

A project with client Herm Kisjes

Our client’s goal as a teacher at Fontys medical health care is to raise awareness of the amount of time that the Fontys students spend on their phones and the outcome of that action which can be both positive and negative.

This is an android application that is able to record different types of activities of the smartphone and present the data in a suitable method that raises the awareness of smartphone impact on the user’s life.
